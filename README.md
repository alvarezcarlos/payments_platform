# Payment Platform Service README

## Introduction
Welcome to the Payment Platform Service repository! This repository hosts a microservice designed to handle customer payments and refunds efficiently.

## Overview
The Payment Platform Service is built to provide a seamless experience for processing payments and refunds in a distributed environment.

## Features
- **Payment Processing**: Accepts and processes customer payments securely and efficiently.
- **Refund Management**: Handles refund requests promptly and accurately, ensuring a smooth customer experience.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built using microservices architecture, allowing seamless scaling to accommodate growing transaction volumes.
- **Secure Transactions**: Implements security measures to protect sensitive payment information and prevent fraud.
## Prerequisites
Before running the Payment Platform Service, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Go (version 1.22.1)
- Postgres (version 15)
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/alvarezcarlos/payments_platform.git
    ```

2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
    ```
    cd paymens_platform
    ```

3. **Build the Docker image** for the Payment Platform Service:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

4. **Start the microservice**:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

5. **Access the Payment Platform Service** through the exposed endpoint.

## Usage
Once the Payment Platform Service is running, you can interact with it through its endpoint. Here is the endpoint for the service:

- **Payment Platform Service**: `http://localhost:8080`

You can initiate payment transactions and refund requests through this endpoint using appropriate HTTP methods and payloads.

## Improvements
While the Payment Platform Service serves its core functionalities effectively, there are several areas where it can be improved for better performance, scalability, and security:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures such as encryption, tokenization for sensitive data as customer and cards information.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate logging and monitoring solutions to track transactions, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues effectively. (by now it's just a log file app.log)
3. **API Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, payloads, and error codes to facilitate easier integration for clients.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize performance to ensure low latency and high throughput even under heavy loads.
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration testing.
